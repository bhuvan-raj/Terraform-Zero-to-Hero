## 🔧 What is IaC (Infrastructure as Code)?

Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using code instead of manual processes. It allows you to define, deploy, and manage infrastructure using configuration files.

### ✅ **Advantages of IaC:**

* **Consistency:** Reduces human errors and configuration drift.
* **Automation:** Enables automated deployments.
* **Version Control:** Track changes and rollback using Git.
* **Scalability:** Easily replicate environments.
* **Speed:** Faster provisioning of infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Popular IaC Tools

* **Terraform** (by HashiCorp) ✅
* AWS CloudFormation
* Azure Resource Manager
* Pulumi
